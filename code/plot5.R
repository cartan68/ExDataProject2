## Description:
##  This script is part of the second project for the
##  Exploratory Data Analysis course. The purpose of the
##  script is to address the question:
##      "How have emissions from motor vehicle sources
##       changed from 1999â€“2008 in Baltimore City?"
##  This script uses the PM2.5 data set, and leverages the
##  ggplot plotting system to make a plot showing the PM2.5
##  emission from motor vehicle sources in Baltimore City 
##  for the years 1999 and 2008.
